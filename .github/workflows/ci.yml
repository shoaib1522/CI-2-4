          # We are now explicitly telling our tests the IP address of the 'redis' service.
          # The syntax `job.services.<service_name>.network_aliases[0]` or simply the service name
          # is the modern way. For maximum compatibility, we reference the host directly.
          # The hostname IS the service ID. Let's ensure the Python code handles this.
